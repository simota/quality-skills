# When a finding needs a picture

A finding a reader has to reassemble in their head is a finding that gets
skimmed, and a skimmed report did not happen. A diagram is not decoration here
— it is the finding, in the form that costs the reader least.

It is also not free. A picture that restates a sentence costs the reader twice:
once to read the sentence, once to check the picture says the same thing.

## The four triggers

A diagram is owed when **any one** of these holds. None of them is "it would
look nice".

| Trigger | Holds when | Because |
|---|---|---|
| `hops` | The finding spans three or more places the reader must hold at once | Prose makes them remember; a picture makes them look |
| `ordering` | It depends on sequence — the same parts in another order would be fine | "Then... then... then" in the prose is the tell |
| `disagreement` | Two things state different values and both must be shown to see it | Two paragraphs make the reader diff them by eye |
| `location` | It is somewhere in a two-dimensional artifact — a region, a crop, a layout | Words for a position are longer and less exact than a mark |

In this family `disagreement` fires most: nearly every finding here is a claim
against its own evidence, and both halves have to be visible to see the gap.
`location` fires least, and when it does it is a position in a grid — what the
diff touched against what was checked.

## When not to

- One place, one line, one sentence. Say it
- The picture would contain exactly what the sentence contains
- Nothing was traced. A diagram of an untraced path is speculation with better
  graphics, and the finding is not at its floor either
- The diagram would need the whole artifact to make sense. Bound it or drop it

## Which form

**ASCII by default.** It survives a terminal, a plain-text report, a commit
message and a diff, and it cannot fail to render. Every trigger above has an
ASCII form in [diagram-forms](../reference/diagram-forms.md).

**Mermaid when the shape is genuinely a graph** — more than about six nodes, or
branching and merging that ASCII would misalign. It needs a renderer, so it is a
trade, not an upgrade.

**Never both for one finding.** Two pictures of one thing is the reader
checking them against each other.

## The floor

A diagram carries the same rung as the finding it belongs to. It never raises
one, and three things keep it a finding rather than an illustration:

- **`labelled`** — every mark names something that was opened. A region, a file,
  a step that exists. An unlabelled box is a guess that looks like a fact
- **`derived`** — it says nothing the evidence did not establish. It adds no hop
  nobody traced and no cause nobody checked
- **`bounded`** — it shows the parts the finding is about and stops. A diagram
  of the whole thing is a second thing to read

**The test:** could a reader who disagrees point at the part of the diagram that
is wrong, and check it? If not, it is not carrying a finding.

## Where it goes

Inside the finding, under the row it belongs to — not in a gallery at the end.
A picture separated from its claim is a puzzle.

One finding, one diagram. Where several findings share a location, one map with
numbered marks and the findings referring to the numbers beats one map each.

## In this family

- **A claim ledger** for anything with `disagreement` — the claim, the rung it
  carries, the rung its kind requires, and the gap on its own line. The default
  here, and the shape most findings in this skill already have
- **A coverage grid** when the finding is that something went unchecked: what
  the diff touched down one axis, what ran across the other, and the empty cell
  as the finding
- **A severity-against-blocking square** when a report's grading is the problem
  — the two are separate axes and a report that collapses them shows it at once
- **An evidence chain** when a claim rests on another claim: each link naming
  what was run and what it showed, and the link that is reasoning alone marked
